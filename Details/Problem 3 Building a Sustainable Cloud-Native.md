Problem 3: Building a Sustainable Cloud-Native
Application with Carbon-Aware Scheduling

Problem Statement: Building a Sustainable Cloud-Native Application with
Carbon-Aware Scheduling
More about the problem:

Create a cloud-native application and a custom Kubernetes scheduler that is "carbon-
aware." The scheduler must ingest real-time data on the carbon intensity of different

cloud regions and automatically migrate containerized workloads to the region with
the greenest energy mix, while staying within defined budget (FinOps) and latency
constraints. The solution must provide a dashboard that visualizes the application's
carbon footprint and cost savings over time.
Focus:
Cloud Sustainability, FinOps, Kubernetes, Green Computing.
Challenge:
Integrating real-time carbon intensity data, building a sophisticated scheduling
algorithm with multiple constraints, and ensuring workload migration is seamless.
